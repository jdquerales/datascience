Data science journey
========================== 

This repository contains a portfolio of my work on my self-directed training on data science using Python. 
Since May 2019, I have been enrolled at DataCamp in order to gain hands-on experience on Data Science methologies 
using Python and SQL.

[Completed projects](DataCamp_projects)

[Certificates](DataCamp_Certicates)

- Data Scientist with Python (88 hours): 

This track includes learning on  how Python  allows us to import, clean, manipulate,
 and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. 
Through interactive exercises, I have  gotten  hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, 
including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. I have worked with real-world datasets 
to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques we need to train decision trees
 and use natural language processing (NLP).

- Data Scientist with Python (60 hours)
